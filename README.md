# Resto

if you get errors loading CSV files check in 

- MenuService
- OrderService
- UserService
- InventoryService
- LoginService
- RestaurantController

The CSV files are included but some of our users had issues with it not reading the file correctly which will break the whole application.
it has to do with how it is pathing to those files.
